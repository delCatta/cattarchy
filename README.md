# An approach to moving out of MacOS

This file saves my configuration changes on top of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/). 

Use `stow` to get my config files!

### Waybar

- Time to the Right: I have my Logitec BRIO sitting in the middle of my monitor. The time gets covered when centered.
- More workspaces: I have a wide monitor.
